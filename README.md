ee302 robot car 
In this project, our team worked with an Arduino Uno microcontroller, photosensors, and IR (distance) sensors to build and program a "robot car" to follow a track made of black tape. The photosensors on the right, middle, and left of the front bumper are "inputs", and based on these values, the car has been programmed to turn clockwise, counterclockwise, or go forward to "stay on the track". Additionally, the distance sensor readings are used to determine whether the car should stop or not (if the distance sensor value reading is above a given threshold).
